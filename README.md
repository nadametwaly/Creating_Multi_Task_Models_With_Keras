# **Creating Multi Task Models With Keras**

## **About The Project!**

I used the Keras and Tensorflow Library, To build a Deep Neural Network to Create a Multi-Task Model.

The Model Will Detect Two Features at a Same Time From a Photo : That is to Determine The Number and The Predominant Colour. We used The MNIST Dataset.

## **Visual Representation!**

**Here, The Image Contain Some Noice and a Predominant Colour.**

## **`Model Architecture!`**

**The Below Image Represent The Architecture as well as The Flow of The Deep Neural Network!**

## **`Model Prediction!`**

**Here, are Some Sample Images Predicted By The Model!**
